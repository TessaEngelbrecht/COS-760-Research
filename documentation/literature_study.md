## Evolution of Machine-Generated Text Detection

The detection of machine-generated text has evolved through three distinct phases. Early statistical approaches like GLTR analyzed word frequency distributions and perplexity scores, achieving 85-90% accuracy for English texts through n-gram analysis [Gehrmann et al., 2019]. However, these methods struggled with morphological complexity in African languages due to agglutinative structures and limited digital corpora [Jawahar et al., 2020]. The second wave introduced transformer-based detectors like RoBERTa-detector, which leveraged contextual embeddings to achieve 97% F1-score on English texts by analyzing syntactic patterns and semantic coherence [Liu et al., 2019]. While effective for high-resource languages, these models required 300+GB of training data—orders of magnitude beyond available African language resources [Ogueji et al., 2021].

The current phase focuses on multilingual adaptive approaches that work better for languages with limited resources. Models like Afro-XLM-R show how we can adapt existing technology to work with African languages by using smart training techniques and sharing knowledge between similar languages [Alabi et al., 2022]. This is important because most current detection tools only work well for English and other major languages, leaving millions of African language speakers without proper tools to identify machine-generated content.

## Challenges in African Language NLP

Working with African languages in NLP presents three major challenges that make detecting machine-generated text much harder. The first and biggest problem is data scarcity. Most African languages have very little digital text available for training models. For example, isiZulu has less than 1 million tokens of digital text, while English has over 3 billion tokens available for researchers [Adelani et al., 2021]. This gap means models trained on African languages often don't have enough examples to learn properly. The problem gets worse because many African languages don't have standardized writing systems, and about 60% of these languages are primarily spoken rather than written [Siminyu et al., 2023].

The second major challenge is model bias. Most AI tools were built with English and other Western languages in mind, so they often make mistakes when working with African languages. For instance, when Google's MarianMT tries to translate isiXhosa proverbs, it gets the cultural meaning wrong about 41% of the time [Stanford, 2023]. This happens because the model doesn't understand the cultural context behind the words. Similarly, when researchers try to use synonym replacement techniques that work well for English, they often mess up the complex grammar rules in Bantu languages, especially the noun class systems that are crucial for meaning [Ghanaian NLP Collective, 2023].

The third challenge is computational constraints. Most African researchers don't have access to powerful computers needed for training large language models. Studies show that over 80% of African NLP researchers can't access GPUs with more than 16GB of memory [Lelapa AI, 2025]. This is a problem because standard models like XLM-R need about 350GB of memory to train properly, which is way beyond what most researchers can afford. This creates a situation where the people who understand these languages best can't build the tools needed to work with them.

## Advancements in Transfer Learning

Recent breakthroughs in transfer learning offer hope for overcoming these challenges. The key insight is that languages in the same family often share similar grammar rules and structures, so a model trained on one language can help with another related language. Afro-XLM-R demonstrates this perfectly by grouping Southern Bantu languages together during training. This approach achieves 78.4% accuracy when transferring knowledge between languages, compared to only 52.1% for regular XLM-R [Alabi et al., 2022]. This is especially useful for our work because isiZulu and isiXhosa share about 83% of their vocabulary and have very similar grammar rules.

Another important advancement is cultural-aware data augmentation. Researchers working on Ghanaian languages found that they could improve model performance by 34% when they included local proverbs and cultural expressions in their training data [Ghanaian NLP Collective, 2023]. This taught us that we can't just translate English text and expect it to work well—we need to understand and preserve the cultural meaning behind African language texts. Our approach builds on this by using native speakers to check and correct machine translations, making sure that important cultural concepts like "ubuntu" in isiZulu are properly represented.

Low-resource optimization techniques also make it possible to train good models without expensive hardware. InkubaLM showed that smart vocabulary management can reduce memory requirements by 76% without hurting performance [Lelapa AI, 2025]. We use similar techniques in our work, including mixed-precision training and gradient accumulation, which let us train our models on regular GPUs that most researchers can access.

## Research Gaps and Our Approach

Despite all these advances, there are still major gaps in machine-generated text detection for African languages. The biggest gap is that no one has built a detector specifically for isiZulu and isiXhosa, even though these languages are spoken by over 19 million people combined. Most existing research focuses on West African languages like Hausa, leaving Southern African languages completely uncovered [Marivate et al., 2025]. This is a serious problem because different African language families have different characteristics, and a model that works for Hausa might not work well for Bantu languages. Another gap is that existing approaches don't take advantage of the similarities between related languages. While researchers have shown that isiZulu and isiXhosa are very similar, no one has built a detection system that uses both languages together to improve performance. Our approach fills this gap by training a single model that can detect machine-generated text in both languages, using their similarities to make up for the limited training data available for each individual language.

The third major gap is the lack of culturally-aware detection methods. Most current systems just look at surface-level features like word frequency, but they miss deeper cultural patterns that human writers naturally include. For example, isiZulu speakers often use specific discourse markers and cultural references that current AI systems struggle to replicate correctly. Our work addresses this by including cultural augmentation techniques and working with native speakers to ensure our training data represents authentic language use.

## Model Choice and Justification

We chose Afro-XLM-R as our base model for several practical reasons. First, it was specifically designed for African languages and already understands the basic grammar and vocabulary of isiZulu and isiXhosa [Alabi et al., 2022]. This means we don't have to teach it these languages from scratch—we can focus our training on the specific task of detecting machine-generated text. Second, Afro-XLM-R is much more efficient than other multilingual models, requiring only 82GB of memory compared to 350GB for regular XLM-R. This makes it possible for us to actually train and test our model with the resources we have available.

The model also uses smart techniques like script-specific vocabulary pruning, which removes unnecessary words and focuses on the most important features for each language. This is particularly helpful for Bantu languages because it preserves important grammatical elements like noun class prefixes while ignoring less relevant vocabulary. Additionally, Afro-XLM-R has already been tested on similar tasks like sentiment analysis and topic classification for African languages, so we know it can handle the complexity of these languages effectively.

Our approach builds on Afro-XLM-R by adding specialized training for machine-generated text detection. We use transfer learning to adapt the model's existing knowledge of isiZulu and isiXhosa for our specific task. We also implement data augmentation techniques including back-translation to make our training data more diverse and robust. This combination gives us a model that understands both the linguistic structure and cultural context of our target languages while being efficient enough to train and deploy in resource-constrained environments.
